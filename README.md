# Beautiful C

> Or how to make your C code more pretty (maybe not)

## Why I made this

I was learning Moonscript syntax and keywords, and was wondering if I could use for instance `unless` (~ if not) keyword using macro system. 

Well, it seems to work!

I was also intrigued by people who were using `auto` for functions declaration in C++ (even when not needed), so I decided to go a step further and replace `auto` by other keywords.

Another step further : why not implement keywords from other languages as well ?
You asked for it (probably not), I coded it.

That said, I don't expect someone to use this in production code.
This project is just an experiment to show that adding keywords to express different ideas in C and C++ is possible.
